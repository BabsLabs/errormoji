# Errormoji

[![Build Status](https://github.com/your_username/errormoji/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your_username/errormoji/actions)

Errormoji is a Ruby gem that adds a touch of fun to your error messages by decorating them with ASCII emojis. Whether you're debugging or just want to make your errors more engaging, Errormoji has you covered!



## Installation

To install Errormoji, add it to your application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add errormoji
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install errormoji
```

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

## Usage

To enable emoji decoration for all exceptions globally, or on a per-environment basis in Rails:

### Enabling Globally
```ruby
require "errormoji"

Errormoji.enable_global_exceptions!

raise "Oops, something went wrong!"
# Output: („Éé‡≤†Áõä‡≤†)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª Oops, something went wrong!
```

### Enabling in Rails (Per-Environment)

Errormoji provides a Railtie for seamless Rails integration. You can opt in or out of emoji error decoration by setting a configuration variable in your Rails environment files:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.config.errormoji_enabled = true
```

The Railtie will automatically enable or disable global exception decoration based on this configuration. For example, you can enable it in `development` and `test` environments but leave it disabled in `production`:

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
Rails.application.config.errormoji_enabled = true

# config/environments/production.rb
Rails.application.config.errormoji_enabled = false
```

**How it works:**  
When Rails boots, the Railtie checks `config.errormoji_enabled`. If set to `true`, Errormoji will decorate exception messages with emojis. If set to `false`, decoration is disabled. This lets you control Errormoji behavior per environment, with no manual initializer required!

**Note:**  
While Errormoji makes your errors way more fun (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†), we don‚Äôt recommend enabling it in production‚Äîunless your ops team loves errormojis as much as you do! Decorated error messages might confuse your logs, monitoring tools, or that one serious developer on your team. But hey, you‚Äôre the boss: enable Errormoji wherever you want!

To disable emoji decoration:

```ruby
Errormoji.disable_global_exceptions!
```

### Customization

You can customize the emojis used by Errormoji:

```ruby
Errormoji.emojis = ["üòÑ", "üò¢", "üò°"]  # Or use your favorite ASCII errormojis!
```

This will replace the default emoji set with your custom list.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

This will run all tests and ensure your changes work as expected.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment with the gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake install
```

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run:

```bash
bundle exec rake release
```

This will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
